abstract: Editing biological sequences has extensive applications in synthetic biology
  and medicine, such as designing regulatory elements for nucleic-acid therapeutics
  and treating genetic disorders. The primary objective in biological-sequence editing
  is to determine the optimal modifications to a sequence which augment certain biological
  properties while adhering to a minimal number of alterations to ensure safety and
  predictability. In this paper, we propose GFNSeqEditor, a novel biological-sequence
  editing algorithm which builds on the recently proposed area of generative flow
  networks (GFlowNets). Our proposed GFNSeqEditor identifies elements within a starting
  seed sequence that may compromise a desired biological property. Then, using a learned
  stochastic policy, the algorithm makes edits at these identified locations, offering
  diverse modifications for each sequence in order to enhance the desired property.
  Notably, GFNSeqEditor prioritizes edits with a higher likelihood of substantially
  improving the desired property. Furthermore, the number of edits can be regulated
  through specific hyperparameters. We conducted extensive experiments on a range
  of real-world datasets and biological applications, and our results underscore the
  superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art
  sequence editing methods.
