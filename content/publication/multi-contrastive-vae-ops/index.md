abstract: Optical pooled screens (OPS) enable unbiased and cost-effective interrogation
  of gene function by generating images of millions of cells across thousands of perturbations.
  However, the analysis of OPS data remains a hurdle because it still mainly relies
  on hand-crafted features, which can be difficult to deploy across complex data sets.
  Additionally, most unsupervised feature extraction methods based on neural networks
  (such as auto-encoders) have difficulty isolating the effect of perturbations from
  the natural variations among cells. We therefore propose a contrastive analysis
  framework that is more effective at disentangling the phenotypes induced by perturbation
  from natural cell-cell heterogeneity present in an unperturbed cell population.
  By analyzing a significant data set of over 30 million cells across more than 5,
  000 genetic perturbations, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
  traditional methods in generating biologically-informative embeddings and mitigating
  technical artifacts. Furthermore, the interpretable part of our model enables us
  to pinpoint perturbations that generate novel phenotypes from the ones that only
  shift the distribution of existing phenotypes. Our approach can be readily applied
  to other small-molecule and genetic perturbation data sets with highly multiplexed
  images, enhancing the efficiency and precision in identifying and interpreting perturbation-specific
  phenotypic patterns, paving the way for deeper insights and discoveries in OPS analysis.
