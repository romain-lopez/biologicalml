abstract: The paired measurement of RNA and surface protein abundance in single cells
  with CITE-seq is a promising approach to connect transcriptional variation with
  cell phenotypes and functions. However, each data modality exhibits unique technical
  biases, making it challenging to conduct a joint analysis and combine these two
  views into a unified representation of cell state. Here we present Total Variational
  Inference (totalVI), a framework for the joint probabilistic analysis of paired
  RNA and protein data from single cells. totalVI probabilistically represents the
  data as a composite of biological and technical factors such as limited sensitivity
  of the RNA data, background in the protein data, and batch effects. To evaluate
  totalVI, we performed CITE-seq on immune cells from murine spleen and lymph nodes
  with biological replicates and with different antibody panels measuring over 100
  surface proteins. With this dataset we demonstrate that totalVI provides a cohesive
  solution for common analysis tasks like the integration of datasets with matched
  or unmatched protein panels, dimensionality reduction, clustering, evaluation of
  correlations between molecules, and differential expression testing. totalVI enables
  scalable, end-to-end analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells and
  is available as open-source software.
