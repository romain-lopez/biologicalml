abstract: Single-cell RNA-sequencing has become a widely used, powerful approach for
  studying cell populations. However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts,
  where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome.
  In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and
  can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Scrublet (Single-Cell Remover
  of Doublets), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis
  and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge
  or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest
  neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet
  on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets.
