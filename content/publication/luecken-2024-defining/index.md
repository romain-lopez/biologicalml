abstract: With the growing number of single-cell analysis tools, benchmarks are increasingly
  important to guide analysis and method development. However, a lack of standardisation
  and extensibility in current benchmarks limits their usability, longevity, and relevance
  to the community. We present Open Problems, a living, extensible, community-guided
  benchmarking platform including 10 current single-cell tasks that we envision will
  raise standards for the selection, evaluation, and development of methods in single-cell
  analysis.
