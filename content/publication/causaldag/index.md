abstract: A common theme in causal inference is learning causal relationships between
  observed variables, also known as causal discovery. This is usually a daunting task,
  given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial nature of
  the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far focused on relatively
  small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes. However, recent advances in fields
  like biology enable generating experimental data sets with thousands of interventions
  followed by rich profiling of thousands of variables, raising the opportunity and
  urgent need for large causal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor
  directed acyclic graphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear
  low-rank causal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with
  recent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous optimization,
  we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables. Additionally, as a model
  for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation procedure, we study a model
  of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based on random graphs and quantify
  the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG rank. This theoretical analysis suggests
  that the set of candidate f-DAGs is much smaller than the whole DAG space and thus
  more statistically robust in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton
  is hard to assess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG),
  a scalable implementation of f-DAG constrained causal discovery for high-dimensional
  interventional data. DCD-FG uses a Gaussian non-linear low-rank structural equation
  model and shows significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods in
  both simulations as well as a recent large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data
  set with hundreds of genetic interventions.
