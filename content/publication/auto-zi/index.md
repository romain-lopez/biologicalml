abstract: In single-cell RNA sequencing data, biological processes or technical factors
  may induce an overabundance of zero measurements. Existing probabilistic approaches
  to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inflated, or none. But
  the overabundance of zeros might be gene-specific. Hence, we propose the AutoZI
  model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment
  between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial
  (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using
  variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each
  gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On
  negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study
  on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several
  datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological
  and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI's decisions on
  mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional
  bursting.
