abstract: It is now possible to conduct large scale perturbation screens with complex
  readout modalities, such as different molecular profiles or high content cell images.
  While these open the way for systematic dissection of causal cell circuits, integrated
  such data across screens to maximize our ability to predict circuits poses substantial
  computational challenges, which have not been addressed. Here, we extend two GromovWasserstein
  Optimal Transport methods to incorporate the perturbation label for cross-modality
  alignment. The obtained alignment is then employed to train a predictive model that
  estimates cellular responses to perturbations observed with only one measurement
  modality. We validate our method for the tasks of cross-modality alignment and cross-modality
  prediction in a recent multimodal single-cell perturbation dataset. Our approach
  opens the way to unified causal models of cell biology.
