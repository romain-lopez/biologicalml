abstract: 'Novel experimental assays now simultaneously measure lineage relationships
  and transcriptomic states from single cells, thanks to CRISPR/Cas9-based genome
  engineering. These multimodal measurements allow researchers not only to build comprehensive
  phylogenetic models relating all cells but also infer transcriptomic determinants
  of consequential subclonal behavior. The gene expression data, however, is limited
  to cells that are currently present (\"leaves\" of the phylogeny). As a consequence,
  researchers cannot form hypotheses about unobserved, or \"ancestral\", states that
  gave rise to the observed population. To address this, we introduce TreeVAE: a probabilistic
  framework for estimating ancestral transcriptional states. TreeVAE uses a variational
  autoencoder (VAE) to model the observed transcriptomic data while accounting for
  the phylogenetic relationships between cells. Using simulations, we demonstrate
  that TreeVAE outperforms benchmarks in reconstructing ancestral states on several
  metrics. TreeVAE also provides a measure of uncertainty, which we demonstrate to
  correlate well with its prediction accuracy. This estimate therefore potentially
  provides a data-driven way to estimate how far back in the ancestor chain predictions
  could be made. Finally, using real data from lung cancer metastasis, we show that
  accounting for phylogenetic relationship between cells improves goodness of fit.
  Together, TreeVAE provides a principled framework for reconstructing unobserved
  cellular states from single cell lineage tracing data.'
