abstract: We address a practical problem ubiquitous in modern industry, in which a
  mediator tries to learn a policy for allocating strategic financial incentives for
  customers in a marketing campaign and observes only bandit feedback. In contrast
  to traditional policy optimization frameworks, we rely on a specific assumption
  for the reward structure and we incorporate budget constraints. We develop a new
  two-step method for solving this constrained counterfactual policy optimization
  problem. First, we cast the reward estimation problem as a domain adaptation problem
  with supplementary structure. Subsequently, the estimators are used for optimizing
  the policy with constraints. We establish theoretical error bounds for our estimation
  procedure and we empirically show that the approach leads to significant improvement
  on both synthetic and real datasets.
