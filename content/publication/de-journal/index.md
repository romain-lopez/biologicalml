abstract: Detecting differentially expressed genes is important for characterizing
  subpopulations of cells. In scRNA-seq data, however, nuisance variation due to technical
  factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying
  biological signal. Deep generative models have been extensively applied to scRNA-seq
  data, with a special focus on embedding cells into a low-dimensional latent space
  and correcting for batch effects. However, little attention has been given to the
  problem of utilizing the uncertainty from the deep generative model for differential
  expression. Furthermore, the existing approaches do not allow controlling for the
  effect size or the false discovery rate. Here, we present lvm-DE, a generic Bayesian
  approach for performing differential expression from using a fitted deep generative
  model, while controlling the false discovery rate. We apply the lvm-DE framework
  to scVI and scSphere, two deep generative models. The resulting approaches outperform
  the state-of-the-art methods at estimating the log fold change in gene expression
  levels, as well as detecting differentially expressed genes between subpopulations
  of cells.
