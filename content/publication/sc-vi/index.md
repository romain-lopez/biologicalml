abstract: Single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal unexplored biological
  diversity, but they suffer from technical noise and bias that must be modeled to
  account for the resulting uncertainty in downstream analyses. Here we introduce
  single-cell variational inference (scVI), a ready-to-use scalable framework for
  the probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells
  (https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI). scVI uses stochastic optimization and deep neural
  networks to aggregate information across similar cells and genes and to approximate
  the distributions that underlie observed expression values, while accounting for
  batch effects and limited sensitivity. We used scVI for a range of fundamental analysis
  tasks including batch correction, visualization, clustering, and differential expression,
  and achieved high accuracy for each task.
