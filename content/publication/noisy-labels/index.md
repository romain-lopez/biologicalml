abstract: Class labels are often imperfectly observed, due to mistakes and to genuine
  ambiguity among classes. We propose a new semi-supervised deep generative model
  that explicitly models noisy labels, called the Mislabeled VAE (M-VAE). The M-VAE
  can perform better than existing deep generative models which do not account for
  label noise. Additionally, the derivation of M-VAE gives new theoretical insights
  into the popular M1+M2 semi-supervised model.
