abstract: Optical pooled screening (OPS) combines automated microscopy and genetic
  perturbations to systematically study gene function in a scalable and cost-effective
  way. Leveraging the resulting data requires extracting biologically informative
  representations of cellular perturbation phenotypes from images. We employ a style-transfer
  approach to learn gene-level feature representations from images of genetically
  perturbed cells obtained via OPS. Our method outperforms widely used engineered
  features in clustering gene representations according to gene function, demonstrating
  its utility for uncovering latent biological relationships. This approach offers
  a promising alternative to investigate the role of genes in health and disease.
