While these open the way for systematic dissection of causal cell circuits, integrated such data across screens to maximize our ability to predict circuits poses substantial computational challenges, which have not been addressed. Here, we extend two GromovWasserstein Optimal Transport methods to incorporate the perturbation label for cross-modality alignment. The obtained alignment is then employed to train a predictive model that estimates cellular responses to perturbations observed with only one measurement modality. We validate our method for the tasks of cross-modality alignment and cross-modality prediction in a recent multimodal single-cell perturbation dataset.

    title = {Toward the Identifiability of Comparative Deep Generative Models},
    journal = {Causal Learning and Reasoning},
    year = {2024},
    abstract ={Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are versatile tools for learning data representations while adequately incorporating domain knowledge such as the specification of conditional probability distributions. Recently proposed DGMs tackle the important task of comparing data sets from different sources. One such example is the setting of contrastive analysis that focuses on describing patterns that are enriched in a target data set compared to a background data set. The practical deployment of those models often assumes that DGMs naturally infer interpretable and modular latent representations, which is known to be an issue in practice. Consequently, existing methods often rely on ad-hoc regularization schemes, although without any theoretical grounding. Here, we propose a theory of identifiability for comparative DGMs by extending recent advances in the field of non-linear independent component analysis. We show that, while these models lack identifiability across a general class of mixing functions, they surprisingly become identifiable when the mixing function is piece-wise affine (e.g., parameterized by a ReLU neural network). We also investigate the impact of model misspecification, and empirically show that previously proposed regularization techniques for fitting comparative DGMs help with identifiability when the number of latent variables is not known in advance. Finally, we introduce a novel methodology for fitting comparative DGMs that improves the treatment of multiple data sources via multi-objective optimization and that helps adjust the hyperparameter for the regularization in an interpretable manner, using constrained optimization. We empirically validate our theory and new methodology using simulated data as well as a recent data set of genetic perturbations in cells profiled via single-cell RNA sequencing.},

	title = {Multi-ContrastiveVAE disentangles perturbation effects in single cell images from optical pooled screens},
	abstract = {Optical pooled screens (OPS) enable unbiased and cost-effective interrogation of gene function by generating images of millions of cells across thousands of perturbations. However, the analysis of OPS data remains a hurdle because it still mainly relies on hand-crafted features, which can be difficult to deploy across complex data sets. Additionally, most unsupervised feature extraction methods based on neural networks (such as auto-encoders) have difficulty isolating the effect of perturbations from the natural variations among cells. We therefore propose a contrastive analysis framework that is more effective at disentangling the phenotypes induced by perturbation from natural cell-cell heterogeneity present in an unperturbed cell population. By analyzing a significant data set of over 30 million cells across more than 5, 000 genetic perturbations, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods in generating biologically-informative embeddings and mitigating technical artifacts. Furthermore, the interpretable part of our model enables us to pinpoint perturbations that generate novel phenotypes from the ones that only shift the distribution of existing phenotypes. Our approach can be readily applied to other small-molecule and genetic perturbation data sets with highly multiplexed images, enhancing the efficiency and precision in identifying and interpreting perturbation-specific phenotypic patterns, paving the way for deeper insights and discoveries in OPS analysis.},

	year = {2023},
	abstract = {CRISPR technology, combined with single-cell RNA-Seq, has opened the way to large scale pooled perturbation screens, allowing more systematic interrogations of gene functions in cells at scale. However, such Perturb-seq data poses many analysis challenges, due to its high-dimensionality, high level of technical noise, and variable Cas9 efficiency. The single-cell nature of the data also poses its own challenges, as we observe the heterogeneity of phenotypes in the unperturbed cells, along with the effect of the perturbations. All in all, these characteristics make it difficult to discern subtler effects. Existing tools, like mixscape and ContrastiveVI, provide partial solutions, but may oversimplify biological dynamics, or have low power to characterize perturbations with a smaller effect size. Here, we address these limitations by introducing the Supervised Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (SC- VAE). SC-VAE integrates guide RNA identity with gene expression data, ensuring a more discriminative analysis, and adopts the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion as a way to achieve disentangled representations, separating the heterogeneity in the control population from the effect of the perturbations. Evaluation on large-scale data sets highlights SC-VAE{\textquoteright}s superior sensitivity in identifying perturbation effects compared to ContrastiveVI, scVI and PCA. The perturbation embeddings better reflect known protein complexes (evaluated on CORUM), while its classifier offers promise in identifying assignment errors and cells escap- ing the perturbation phenotype. SC-VAE is readily applicable across diverse perturbation data sets.},

	year = {2024},
	abstract = {Understanding a cell{\textquoteright}s expression response to genetic perturbations helps to address important challenges in biology and medicine, including the function of gene circuits, discovery of therapeutic targets and cell reprogramming and engineering. In recent years, Perturb-seq, pooled genetic screens with single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) readouts, has emerged as a common method to collect such data. However, irrespective of technological advances, because combinations of gene perturbations can have unpredictable, non-additive effects, the number of experimental configurations far exceeds experimental capacity, and for certain cases, the number of available cells. While recent machine learning models, trained on existing Perturb-seq data sets, can predict perturbation outcomes with some degree of accuracy, they are currently limited by sub-optimal training set selection and the small number of cell contexts of training data, leading to poor predictions for unexplored parts of perturbation space. As biologists deploy Perturb-seq across diverse biological systems, there is an enormous need for algorithms to guide iterative experiments while exploring the large space of possible perturbations and their combinations. Here, we propose a sequential approach for designing Perturb-seq experiments that uses the model to strategically select the most informative perturbations at each step for subsequent experiments. This enables a significantly more efficient exploration of the perturbation space, while predicting the effect of the rest of the unseen perturbations with high-fidelity. Analysis of a previous large-scale Perturb-seq experiment reveals that our setting is severely restricted by the number of examples and rounds, falling into a non-conventional active learning regime called {\textquotedblleft}active learning on a budget{\textquotedblright}. Motivated by this insight, we develop IterPert, a novel active learning method that exploits rich and multi-modal prior knowledge in order to efficiently guide the selection of subsequent perturbations. Using prior knowledge for this task is novel, and crucial for successful active learning on a budget. We validate IterPert using insilico benchmarking of active learning, constructed from a large-scale CRISPRi Perturb-seq data set. We find that IterPert outperforms other active learning strategies by reaching comparable accuracy at only a third of the number of perturbations profiled as the next best method. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of sequentially designing perturbation screens through IterPert.},

abstract = {Editing biological sequences has extensive applications in synthetic biology and medicine, such as designing regulatory elements for nucleic-acid therapeutics and treating genetic disorders. The primary objective in biological-sequence editing is to determine the optimal modifications to a sequence which augment certain biological properties while adhering to a minimal number of alterations to ensure safety and predictability. In this paper, we propose GFNSeqEditor, a novel biological-sequence editing algorithm which builds on the recently proposed area of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). Our proposed GFNSeqEditor identifies elements within a starting seed sequence that may compromise a desired biological property. Then, using a learned stochastic policy, the algorithm makes edits at these identified locations, offering diverse modifications for each sequence in order to enhance the desired property. Notably, GFNSeqEditor prioritizes edits with a higher likelihood of substantially improving the desired property. Furthermore, the number of edits can be regulated through specific hyperparameters. We conducted extensive experiments on a range of real-world datasets and biological applications, and our results underscore the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art sequence editing methods.},

	abstract = {Detecting differentially expressed genes is important for characterizing subpopulations of cells. In scRNA-seq data, however, nuisance variation due to technical factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying biological signal. Deep generative models have been extensively applied to scRNA-seq data, with a special focus on embedding cells into a low-dimensional latent space and correcting for batch effects. However, little attention has been given to the problem of utilizing the uncertainty from the deep generative model for differential expression. Furthermore, the existing approaches do not allow controlling for the effect size or the false discovery rate. Here, we present lvm-DE, a generic Bayesian approach for performing differential expression from using a fitted deep generative model, while controlling the false discovery rate. We apply the lvm-DE framework to scVI and scSphere, two deep generative models. The resulting approaches outperform the state-of-the-art methods at estimating the log fold change in gene expression levels, as well as detecting differentially expressed genes between subpopulations of cells.},

abstract = {Learning causal relationships between variables is a well-studied problem in statistics, with many important applications in science. However, modeling real-world systems remain challenging, as most existing algorithms assume that the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While this is a convenient framework for developing theoretical developments about causal reasoning and inference, the underlying modeling assumption is likely to be violated in real systems, because feedback loops are common (e.g., in biological systems). Although a few methods search for cyclic causal models, they usually rely on some form of linearity, which is also limiting, or lack a clear underlying probabilistic model. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning nonlinear cyclic causal graphical models from interventional data, called NODAGS-Flow. We perform inference via direct likelihood optimization, employing techniques from residual normalizing flows for likelihood estimation. Through synthetic experiments and an application to single-cell high-content perturbation screening data, we show significant performance improvements with our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods with respect to structure recovery and predictive performance.},

abstract = {Latent variable models have become a go-to tool for analyzing biological data, especially in the field of single-cell genomics. One remaining challenge is the identification of individual latent variables related to biological pathways, more generally conceptualized as disentanglement. Although versions of variational autoencoders that explicitly promote disentanglement were introduced and applied to single-cell genomics data, the theoretical feasibility of disentanglement from independent and identically distributed measurements has been challenged. Recent methods propose instead to leverage non-stationary data, as well as the sparse mechanism assumption in order to learn disentangled representations, with a causal semantic. Here, we explore the application of these methodological advances in the analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical perturbations. We benchmark these methods on simulated single cell expression data to evaluate their performance regarding disentanglement, causal target identification and out-of-domain generalisation. Finally, by applying the approaches to a large-scale gene perturbation data set, we find that the model relying on the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis surpasses contemporary methods on a transfer learning task.},

  title = {Large-scale differentiable causal discovery of factor graphs},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {A common theme in causal inference is learning causal relationships between observed variables, also known as causal discovery. This is usually a daunting task, given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial nature of the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far focused on relatively small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes. However, recent advances in fields like biology enable generating experimental data sets with thousands of interventions followed by rich profiling of thousands of variables, raising the opportunity and urgent need for large causal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor directed acyclic graphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear low-rank causal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with recent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous optimization, we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables. Additionally, as a model for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation procedure, we study a model of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based on random graphs and quantify the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG rank. This theoretical analysis suggests that the set of candidate f-DAGs is much smaller than the whole DAG space and thus more statistically robust in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton is hard to assess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG), a scalable implementation of f-DAG constrained causal discovery for high-dimensional interventional data. DCD-FG uses a Gaussian non-linear low-rank structural equation model and shows significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods in both simulations as well as a recent large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data set with hundreds of genetic interventions.},

	abstract = {The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).},

Many of the models being deployed are amenable to scalable stochastic inference techniques, and accordingly they are able to process single-cell datasets of realistic and growing sizes. However, the community-wide adoption of probabilistic approaches is hindered by a fractured software ecosystem resulting in an array of packages with distinct, and often complex interfaces. To address this issue, we developed scvi-tools (https://scvi-tools.org), a Python package that implements a variety of leading probabilistic methods. These methods, which cover many fundamental analysis tasks, are accessible through a standardized, easy-to-use interface with direct links to Scanpy, Seurat, and Bioconductor workflows. By standardizing the implementations, we were able to develop and reuse novel functionalities across different models, such as support for complex study designs through nonlinear removal of unwanted variation due to multiple covariates and reference-query integration via scArches. The extensible software building blocks that underlie scvi-tools also enable a developer environment in which new probabilistic models for single cell omics can be efficiently developed, benchmarked, and deployed. We demonstrate this through a code-efficient reimplementation of Stereoscope for deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics profiles. By catering to both the end user and developer audiences, we expect scvi-tools to become an essential software dependency and serve to formulate a community standard for probabilistic modeling of single cell omics.},

TreeVAE uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model the observed transcriptomic data while accounting for the phylogenetic relationships between cells. Using simulations, we demonstrate that TreeVAE outperforms benchmarks in reconstructing ancestral states on several metrics. TreeVAE also provides a measure of uncertainty, which we demonstrate to correlate well with its prediction accuracy. This estimate therefore potentially provides a data-driven way to estimate how far back in the ancestor chain predictions could be made. Finally, using real data from lung cancer metastasis, we show that accounting for phylogenetic relationship between cells improves goodness of fit. Together, TreeVAE provides a principled framework for reconstructing unobserved cellular states from single cell lineage tracing data.},

abstract="In this thesis, we pursue the design of Bayesian models as well as large-scale approximate inference procedures for the analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data.

First, we rely on Bayesian statistics to formalize several central algorithmic steps of single-cell transcriptomics data analysis. In particular, we introduce single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a deep generative model that separates technical noise from biological signal, and is readily applicable de novo cell type identification, batch effect correction and differential expression. As a follow-up work, we introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), an extension of scVI for sharing annotation of cells across experimental conditions. scANVI is a fully-probabilistic method for harmonizing collections of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, and therefore provides a principled way of quantifying the uncertainty of cell states annotation. The inference procedure for both methods is based on auto-encoding variational Bayes, and scales to millions of cells.  

In a second line of work, we expose two pathological behaviors of variational inference we encountered while developing scVI. First, the presence of an encoder network leads to entanglement of the latent variables, an undesirable behavior for factoring out unwanted variations from embeddings. To address this problem, we introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion (HSIC) constrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a generic variant of the VAE that incorporates a non-parametric measure of dependence as an explicit constraint for the variational distribution. Second, we expose the unsuitability of the variational distribution for Bayesian decision-making and introduce a simple procedure for making more accurate decisions with VAEs. In particular, we explore alternative training procedures, based on using separate variational bounds for learning the generative model and variational posterior."

abstract="We study the problem of batch learning from bandit feedback in the setting of extremely large action spaces. Learning from extreme bandit feedback is ubiquitous in recommendation systems, in which billions of decisions are made over millions of choices in a single day, yielding massive observational data. In these large-scale real-world applications, supervised learning approaches such as eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) remain the standard approach despite the bias inherent in the data collection process. Conversely, previously developed importance sampling approaches are unbiased but suffer from impractical variance when dealing with a large number of actions. 
In this paper, we introduce a selective importance sampling estimator (sIS) with more favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Specifically, sIS is obtained by performing importance sampling on the conditional expectation of the reward with respect to a small subset of actions for each instance (a form of Rao-Blackwellization). We employ this estimator in a novel algorithmic procedure---named Policy Optimization for eXtreme Models (POXM)---for learning from bandit feedback on XMC tasks. In POXM, the selected actions for the sIS estimator are the top-p actions of the logging policy, where p is adjusted from the data and is significantly smaller than the size of the action space. 
We use a supervised-to-bandit conversion on three XMC datasets to benchmark our POXM method against BanditNet, a previously applied partial matching pruning strategy as well as a supervised learning baseline. Whereas BanditNet sometimes improves marginally over the logging policy, our experiments show that POXM systematically and significantly improves over all baselines."

However, each data modality exhibits unique technical biases, making it challenging to conduct a joint analysis and combine these two views into a unified representation of cell state. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a framework for the joint probabilistic analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells. totalVI probabilistically represents the data as a composite of biological and technical factors such as limited sensitivity of the RNA data, background in the protein data, and batch effects. To evaluate totalVI, we performed CITE-seq on immune cells from murine spleen and lymph nodes with biological replicates and with different antibody panels measuring over 100 surface proteins. With this dataset we demonstrate that totalVI provides a cohesive solution for common analysis tasks like the integration of datasets with matched or unmatched protein panels, dimensionality reduction, clustering, evaluation of correlations between molecules, and differential expression testing. totalVI enables scalable, end-to-end analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells and is available as open-source software.},

abstract="As single-cell transcriptomics becomes a mainstream technology, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulating data in order to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. However, owing to various nuisance factors of variation, it is not straightforward how to compare gene expression levels across data sets and how to automatically assign cell type labels in a new data set based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of cohorts of single-cell RNA-seq data sets, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage any available cell state annotations --- for instance when only one data set in a cohort is annotated, or when only a few cells in a single data set can be labeled using marker genes. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to the existing methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings such as a hierarchical structure of cell state labels. We further show that different from existing methods, scVI and scANVI represent the integrated datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for any probabilistic decision making task, using differential expression as our case study. scVI and scANVI are available as open source software and can be readily used to facilitate cell state annotation and help ensure consistency and reproducibility across studies.",

abstract = {To make decisions based on a model fit by auto-encoding variational Bayes (AEVB), practitioners often let the variational distribution serve as a surrogate for the posterior distribution. This approach yields biased estimates of the expected risk, and therefore poor decisions for two reasons. First, the model fit by AEVB may yield biased statistics relative to the underlying data distribution. Second, there may be strong discrepancies between the variational distribution and the posterior. 
We explore how fitting the variational distribution based on several objective functions other than the ELBO, while continuing to fit the generative model based on the ELBO, affects the quality of downstream decisions.
For a particular model that is amenable to analysis, we investigate how importance sampling error as well as the biases in model parameter estimates vary across several approximate posteriors when used as proposal distributions.
Our theoretical results suggest that a posterior approximation distinct from the variational distribution should be used for making decisions. Motivated by these theoretical results, we propose learning several approximate proposals for the best model and combining them using multiple importance sampling for decision-making. In addition to toy examples, we present a full-fledged case study of single-cell RNA sequencing. In this challenging instance of multiple hypothesis testing, our proposed approach surpasses the current state of the art.}}

Initially developed for computer vision and natural language processing, these models have been shown to effectively summarize the complexity that underlies many types of data and enable a range of applications including supervised analysis, such as assigning labels to images, unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction, and extrapolation analysis such as de-novo generation of artificial images. With this early success, the power of generative models is now being increasingly leveraged in molecular biology, with applications ranging from designing new molecules with properties of interest, to identifying deleterious mutations in our genomes, and to making sense out of transcriptional variability between single cells. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the technical notions behind generative models and their implementation with deep learning techniques. We then describe several different ways in which these models can be utilized in practice, using several recent applications in molecular biology as examples.",

We develop a new two-step method for solving this constrained counterfactual policy optimization problem. First, we cast the reward estimation problem as a domain adaptation problem with supplementary structure. Subsequently, the estimators are used for optimizing the policy with constraints. We establish theoretical error bounds for our estimation procedure and we empirically show that the approach leads to significant improvement on both synthetic and real datasets.",

Existing probabilistic approaches to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inflated, or none. But the overabundance of zeros might be gene-specific. Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI's decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional bursting.",

Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. In totalVI, the mRNA and protein measurements for each cell are generated from a low-dimensional latent random variable unique to that cell, representing its cellular state. totalVI uses deep neural networks to specify conditional distributions. By leveraging advances in stochastic variational inference, it scales easily to millions of cells. Explicit modeling of nuisance factors enables totalVI to produce denoised data in both domains, as well as a batch-corrected latent representation of cells for downstream analysis tasks.",

We show how to apply this method to a range of problems, including the problems of learning invariant representations and the learning of interpretable representations.
